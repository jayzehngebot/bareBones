# "Simply get startd"


I made this so I'd have a nice blank slate to get cracking on class assignments with.

The astro example stuff is super helpful, but I found myself commenting out more code than I'd be writing.

so. the idea here is a bareBones Node + Express 3 + Skeleton Scenario. Hopefully this is not bad.

Lemme know if you use it? If it's helpful?
